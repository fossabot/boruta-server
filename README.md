Boruta is a standalone authorization server implementing OAuth 2.0 and Openid Connect specifications. It provides administration tools and a customizable identity provider out of the box to manage authorization, but also a gateway to apply access rules to incoming traffic.

## Status

This server is on an ongoing beta stage. Developments are moving fast on master then are keen to be less stable. Tagged versions are said to be more stable and sanity tested.

As far as I know, there are no production deployments of the server. I would be happy to contribute to deployments if ones want to go for it. Reach out, we can discuss the needs of your use case.

## Implemented specifications and certification

As it, boruta server aim to follow the RFCs from IETF:
- [RFC 6749 - The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749)
- [RFC 7662 - OAuth 2.0 Token Introspection](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7662)
- [RFC 7009 - OAuth 2.0 Token Revocation](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7009)
- [RFC 7636 - Proof Key for Code Exchange by OAuth Public Clients](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636)

And the specifications from the OpenID Foundation:
- [OpenID Connect core 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html)

This server has been certified for the Basic, Implicit and Hybrid OpenID Provider profiles by the OpenID Foundation on October, 18th 2022 for the tagged version 0.1.0

## Installation

### Requirements
- Elixir >= 1.13
- postgreSQL >= 13
- node >= 16.5 (if you need to prepare assets)

### Run an instance from docker-compose

1. build the docker images

```bash
docker-compose build
```

2. run database migrations

```bash
docker-compose run boruta ./bin/boruta eval "Boruta.Release.setup()"
```

Once done, you can run the docker images as follow:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

The applications will be available on different ports (depending on the docker compose environment configuration):
- http://localhost:8080 for the authorization server
- http://localhost:8081 for the admin interface
- http://localhost:8082 for the gateway

### Run a release from scratch

1. first you need to get project dependencies

```bash
mix deps.get
```

2. you need to prepare assets in order for them to be included in the release

```bash
./scripts/prepare_assets.sh
```

3. then you can craft the release

```bash
MIX_ENV=prod mix release
```

4. finally setup database

```bash
env $(cat .env.example | xargs) _build/prod/rel/boruta/bin/boruta eval "Boruta.Release.setup()"
```

Once done, you can run the release as follow:

```bash
env $(cat .env.example | xargs) _build/prod/rel/boruta/bin/boruta start
```

The applications will be available on different ports (depending on the values provided in `.env.example`):
- http://localhost:8080 for the authorization server
- http://localhost:8081 for the admin interface
- http://localhost:8082 for the gateway

### Run a development server

1. first you need to get project dependencies

```bash
mix deps.get
```

2. you need to prepare assets in order to fetch javascript dependencies

```bash
./scripts/prepare_assets.sh
```

3. create, migrate and seed database

```bash
env $(cat .env.dev | xargs) mix ecto.create
env $(cat .env.dev | xargs) mix ecto.migrate
env $(cat .env.dev | xargs) mix run apps/boruta_auth/priv/repo/boruta.seeds.exs
```

4. because of the forwarding of requests between web and identity modules, you need to add the `/accounts` path prefix in configuration

```diff
--- a/apps/boruta_identity/config/config.exs
+++ b/apps/boruta_identity/config/config.exs
@@ -4,8 +4,8 @@ config :boruta_identity,
   ecto_repos: [BorutaAuth.Repo, BorutaIdentity.Repo]

 config :boruta_identity, BorutaIdentityWeb.Endpoint,
-  url: [host: "localhost"],
-  # url: [host: "localhost", path: "/accounts"],
+  # url: [host: "localhost"],
+  url: [host: "localhost", path: "/accounts"],
```

You now should be able to start the development server

```bash
env $(cat .env.dev | xargs) MIX_ENV=dev mix boruta.server
```

The applications will be available on different ports (depending on the values provided in `.env.dev`):
- http://localhost:4000 for the authorization server
- http://localhost:4001 for the admin interface
- http://localhost:4002 for the gateway

### Default admin credentials

In order to authenticate to the administration interface you will be asked for credentials that are by default (seeded from environment variables) `admin@test.test` / `imaynotknowthat`.
